Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on various health parameters. By leveraging data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms, this project aims to create a predictive model that provides reliable diabetes predictions.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to utilize supervised machine learning models to predict diabetes. Using health-related input features such as blood glucose level, BMI, age, and more, the model is trained to predict the presence or absence of diabetes. This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to explore and implement different stages of machine learning development, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is based on health parameters associated with diabetes patients. It includes features like:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over a 2-hour period
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/height in mÂ²)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Binary variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)

Project Structure
4_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
Workflow
The project follows these primary steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling to prepare the dataset for training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize feature distributions and correlations to understand data relationships.
Model Selection and Training: Train and evaluate various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to select the best-performing model.
Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Models Used
The project compares the performance of the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Each model's performance is evaluated to determine the most effective one for predicting diabetes.

Results
After evaluating the models, the project concludes with model performance metrics and highlights the model that shows the highest accuracy and generalization on the test data. ROC and AUC metrics are also used to validate model reliability.
