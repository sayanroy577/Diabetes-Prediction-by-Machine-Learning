Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

The 4_Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb notebook demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict diabetes using patient health data. It involves preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Feature Scaling and building predictive models like Logistic Regression, K Neighbour Classifier, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest. The notebook evaluates models using metrics like accuracy to identify the most effective predictor of diabetes risk.
